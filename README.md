# AI_Presidents
Creates short-form vertical videos of AI-generated discussions between Trump, Biden, and Obama 

This program allows a person to generate mobile content for TikTok in which Biden, Obama, and Trump will discuss an AI-generated topic while also being given an AI-generated makeover. A user can also choose to specify their chosen topic and how many videos they want made all at once.

To specify a topic, you use a sentence with a type of person followed by a background, such as "A detective at a crime scene" or "A cowboy in a saloon." This will then tell DALL-E to generate pictures of the presidents as detectives or pirates, as well as telling ChatGPT to generate a script that fits the image. It also appends gameplay footage in the lower half.

You will have to make your own confidential.py file and give your access keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs, as well as providing your own gameplay content.
